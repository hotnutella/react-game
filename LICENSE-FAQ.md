## Detailed Questions & Answers

### General Usage

**Q: Can I use ReactGame for free?**
A: Yes! ReactGame is free to use for most purposes, including building commercial games and applications.

**Q: Can I make money with ReactGame?**
A: Absolutely! You can build and sell games, create client projects, or use ReactGame in your commercial products without paying any fees.

**Q: Do I need to pay royalties on games I make?**
A: No royalties are required. Build and sell your games freely.

### Commercial Use Restrictions

**Q: What exactly is prohibited under the license?**
A: You cannot create products that compete directly with ReactGame as a game development framework. Specifically:

- Building your own game development framework using ReactGame as a foundation
- Creating a hosted game development service or platform
- Packaging ReactGame into a competing developer tool suite
- Offering "ReactGame-as-a-Service" or similar managed offerings

**Q: Can I create a game engine that uses ReactGame internally?**
A: This falls into a gray area. If your engine is primarily offering different functionality and ReactGame is just one component, it may be acceptable. However, if the core value proposition competes with ReactGame, you would need a commercial license. When in doubt, please contact us.

**Q: Can I create tutorials, courses, or educational content about ReactGame?**
A: Yes! Educational content, tutorials, courses, and documentation about ReactGame are encouraged and allowed.

**Q: Can I offer consulting services around ReactGame?**
A: Yes! Consulting, training, and development services using ReactGame are permitted.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Can I modify ReactGame's source code?**
A: Yes, you can modify ReactGame for your own use. If you want to redistribute your modifications, they must also comply with the BUSL-1.1 license terms.

**Q: Can I contribute back to ReactGame?**
A: Yes! Contributions are welcome and encouraged. Contributors retain copyright to their contributions, but they are licensed under the same BUSL-1.1 terms.

**Q: Can I fork ReactGame?**
A: Yes, but your fork must also comply with the BUSL-1.1 license terms. You cannot use a fork to circumvent the commercial use restrictions.

### License Timeline

**Q: When does the license change?**
A: On September 27, 2032, ReactGame will automatically become available under the Apache-2.0 license, which is a permissive open-source license with minimal restrictions.

**Q: What happens after the Change Date?**
A: After September 27, 2032, you can use ReactGame under Apache-2.0 terms, which allows almost any use including creating competing frameworks.

**Q: Can I wait until 2032 to use ReactGame commercially?**
A: You don't need to wait! Most commercial uses are already permitted under the current license. Only uses that compete directly with ReactGame as a framework require waiting or obtaining a commercial license.

### Commercial Licensing

**Q: How do I get a commercial license?**
A: Commercial licensing will be available closer to ReactGame v1.0. For now, most use cases are covered by the Additional Use Grant. If you're unsure whether your use case is permitted, please contact Hanows OÃœ.

**Q: How much will commercial licenses cost?**
A: Pricing has not been announced yet. It will be reasonable and designed to support the continued development of ReactGame.

**Q: What would a commercial license allow me to do?**
A: A commercial license would remove the restrictions in the Additional Use Grant, allowing you to create competing frameworks or services based on ReactGame.

### Legal Questions

**Q: What if I'm not sure if my use case is allowed?**
A: When in doubt, please contact Hanows OÃœ (maintainer: Deniss Suhhanov) for clarification. We're happy to help determine if your use case falls under the permitted uses.

**Q: What happens if I violate the license?**
A: License violations automatically terminate your rights to use ReactGame. You would need to either comply with the license terms or obtain a commercial license to continue using it.

**Q: Can I use ReactGame in open-source projects?**
A: Yes! You can use ReactGame in open-source projects, but your project doesn't need to be open-source just because it uses ReactGame.
